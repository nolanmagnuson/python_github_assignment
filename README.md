# Study Time Tracker

This is a simple Python program for my Intro to Python assignment. The program asks the user how many hours they studied today and then estimates how many hours they will study in a whole week. It also has basic error handling so it doesn’t crash if someone types something that is not a number.

## How to Run

python app.py

# Sample Output
Enter hours studied today: 2
You are on track to study 14 hours this week.
